# Age and Gender Prediction using Caffe

This project develops a deep learning model capable of predicting a person's age and gender from facial images. The model is built using the **Caffe** deep learning framework.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict age and gender from facial images.
- **Framework:** Caffe
- **Approach:** Use pretrained models and fine-tune on a labeled dataset of faces.
- **Techniques Used:** 
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Transfer Learning
  - Model Evaluation
